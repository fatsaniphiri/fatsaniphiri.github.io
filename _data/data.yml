        tagline: "Segmenting single-view 3D point clouds with Machine Learning. 

                  In this project, we aim to automate the classification and segmentation of points in 3D point
                  clouds using the Machine Learning Classification techniques namely Random Forest, SVM
                  and K-Nearest Neighbor. Using laser scanners detailed scenes of surfaces are captured and
                  the information is stored in the form of points x,y,z and may also include the colour
                  component red, green and blue. These colours are used to illustrate the label or class of a
                  given point.
                  In this experiment we will leverage the properties of the surrounding area of a point, to
                  generate classification models that will label each point in the 3D point cloud. These
                  properties are called geometric features. The label keys are 1: man-made terrain, 2: natural
                  terrain, 3: high vegetation, 4: low vegetation, 5: buildings, 6: hardscape, 7: scanning
                  artefacts, 8: cars."

        tagline: "Meta-heuristics are a sub-field of biologically inspired artificial intelligence and general 
                  algorithmic frameworks that can be applied to different optimisation problems with relative 
                  few modifications to adapt them to a specific problem. This course examines the theory and 
                  application of several different meta-heuristic methods, including: iterated local search, tabu search, evolutionary algorithms, ant colony optimisation, simulated annealing, and particle swarm optimisation. "
